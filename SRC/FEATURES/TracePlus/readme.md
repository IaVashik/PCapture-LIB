## [TracePlus/settings.nut](#traceplussettingsnut)

This file defines the `TracePlus.Settings` class, which encapsulates settings for ray traces, including options for entity filtering, model filtering, custom collision and ignore filters, and parameters for precise trace line analysis in the `TraceLineAnalyzer` class. 

### [`TracePlus.Settings`](#traceplussettings)

This class stores various settings that control the behavior of traces, such as which entities and models to ignore, custom filter functions, and parameters for precise trace line analysis.

**Properties:**

*   `ignoreClasses` (ArrayEx): An array of entity classnames to ignore during traces. Supports masks, e.g., `["trigger_"]` will ignore all entities with "trigger\_" in their classnames.
*   `priorityClasses` (ArrayEx): An array of entity classnames to prioritize during traces. Supports masks.
*   `ignoredModels` (ArrayEx): An array of entity model names to ignore during traces. Supports masks.
*   `shouldRayHitEntity` (function or null): A custom function to determine if a ray should hit an entity. This function is used as a collision filter.
*   `shouldIgnoreEntity` (function or null): A custom function to determine if an entity should be ignored during a trace. This function is used as an ignore filter.
*   `depthAccuracy` (number): Controls the step size in the deep search algorithm of the `TraceLineAnalyzer` for bbox casts. Lower values increase precision but may impact performance. It's useful when the ray needs to hit very thin objects. (Default: 5, clamped between 0.3 and 15)
*   `bynaryRefinement` (boolean): Enables an additional search level in the `TraceLineAnalyzer` for bbox casts to further improve the accuracy of the hit point. It's crucial when precise hit point calculation is needed, especially for accurate surface normal calculation. (Default: false)

**Methods:**

*   `new(settingsTable)`: Creates a new `TracePlus.Settings` object with default values or initializes it from a table of settings.

    .AppendPriorityClasses(List("player"))
    .SetDepthAccuracy(10) 
    .SetBynaryRefinement(false)
```

## [TracePlus/results.nut](#traceplusresultsnut)

    printl("Trace hit something at:" + traceResult.GetHitpos())
    local normal = traceResult.GetImpactNormal()
    // ... do something with the normal
}
```

## [Portal Castings - How to Use](#portal-castings---how-to-use)

To ensure the correct functionality of portal casting, it's crucial to follow these guidelines:

### [`prop_portal`](#prop_portal)

If `prop_portal` is created manually and has a non-zero `paidId`, you need to add the keyvalue `health` with a value matching the `paidId`. This is necessary for more accurate partner portal detection.

todo: add photo

### [`linked_portal_door`](#linked_portal_door)

For correct operation, you need to create the keyvalue `model` with the portal's `width height` values. For example: `128 64`. The `model` keyvalue is used by the `TracePlus` module to calculate the bounding box of the portal.

todo: add photo

### [Disabling Portals](#disabling-portals)

* To correctly disable portals for a `pcapEntity` portal, you need to call the `SetTraceIgnore` method. You can achieve this by adding the `OnUser1` output to the portal entity and connecting it to a script that calls `SetTraceIgnore`.

todo: add photo

**Alternatively, you can automate this process using the `func_portal_detector` entity on your map.** This entity can detect when a portal is opened or closed and automatically trigger the appropriate script to enable or disable the portal for tracing.

**Note:**
* For advanced scenarios, you can create custom filter functions for `TracePlus.Settings` to define specific rules for ray tracing collisions and entity ignoring.

**BBox Casting Algorithm:**

The `TraceLineAnalyzer` class implements a sophisticated BBox Casting algorithm for accurate and efficient collision detection. A detailed description of the algorithm, including its steps, optimizations, and code examples, can be found in the [bbox\_analyzer.md](bbox_analyzer.md) file.

## [TracePlus/calculate\_normal.nut](#tracepluscalculate_normalnut)

This file provides functions for calculating the impact normal of a surface hit by a trace. It offers three distinct algorithms to address different scenarios, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency in determining the surface orientation at the hit point.

### [Global Functions:](#global-functions)

*   **`CalculateImpactNormal(startPos, hitPos)`:**
    Calculates the impact normal of a surface hit by a trace, primarily for world geometry. It utilizes the "three-ray method" to determine the surface orientation. This method involves performing three cheap traces – one from the original hit position and two from slightly offset positions – to create a triangle. The normal of this triangle represents the surface normal. This approach is efficient but might not be suitable for dynamic entities.
    
*   **`CalculateImpactNormalFromBbox(startPos, hitPos, hitEntity)`:**
    Calculates the impact normal of a surface for dynamic entities, utilizing the hit entity's bounding box. It employs an optimized algorithm that assumes one of the hit point's coordinates is shared by at least four vertices of the bounding box. This assumption allows for efficient identification of the hit face and calculation of its normal. If this optimized method fails to find a suitable face, it falls back to `CalculateImpactNormalFromBbox2`.
    
*   **`CalculateImpactNormalFromBbox2(startPos, hitPos, hitEntity)`:**
    Calculates the impact normal of a surface for dynamic entities as a fallback method when `CalculateImpactNormalFromBbox` cannot determine a reliable normal. It identifies the three closest vertices of the bounding box to the hit point and uses them to form a triangle. The normal of this triangle is then used as an approximation of the surface normal. This method is less precise than `CalculateImpactNormalFromBbox` but is more robust in handling inaccurate hit points.
    
**Impact Normal Calculation Algorithms:**

A detailed description of the algorithms used in `calculate_normal.nut`, including their steps, limitations, and considerations, can be found in the [calculate\_normal.md](calculate_normal.md) file.
